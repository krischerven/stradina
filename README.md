``` clojure
;; Add a Google Maps API key
(add-API-key :maps "FIXME_PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")

;; Print customized directions between two local destinations
(print-directions "Detroit Institute of Art, Detroit, MI" "Max M. & Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center, Detroit, MI")

;; Add a walk data point to local storage (330 meters, 300 seconds)
(add-walk-data-point "Somewhere I went earlier" 330 300)

;; Add a walk data point to local storage (500 meters, 300 seconds)
(add-walk-data-point-with-note "Somewhere I went after that" "NOTE: walked about 50% faster than usual" 500 300)

;; Check our walk speed/time
(my-average-walk-speed)
(my-average-walk-time)

;; Ask a local AI model to interpret our walk data (redacting notes and tags to be safe)
(ollama-interpret-movement-data (redact (walk-data)))
```
