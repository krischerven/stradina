#+title: Rationales

#+subtitle: store/cache are represented as Clojure code
The store and cache are represented as Clojure code so you can quickly paste them into the REPL
for debugging.

#+subtitle: :movement-data over :walk-data + :jog-data + :run-data
This is so you can work with movement data directly, in addition to each of the individual types
of movement data (walk, jog, run)

#+subtitle: :pending-walk-data, :pending-jog-data, :pending-run-data over :pending-movement-data
This is because there is never a need to work generically with pending movement data
